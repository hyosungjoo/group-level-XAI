# Introduction
This project aims to develop a method for obtaining the group-level interpretation of EEG signals using a compact convolutional neural network (CNN). The group-level analysis comprises three procedures: feature extraction, clustering of convolutional filters, and selective interpretation of task-relevant clusters. The source code includes clustering of convolutional filters and selective interpretation. Feature extraction procedure can vary depending on the model and task, so you can make your feature extraction code using a model interpretability library (e.g., Captum). The source code for feature extraction is available upon reasonable request.

# Requirements
* MATLAB >= 2020b
* EEGLab >= 2021.1 (NEED FieldTrip Plugin)

# Function 1: Fx_cnn_group_level
### Overview
This function includes two procedures: clustering of convolutional filters and selective interpretation.
Feature extraction and dipole fitting should be preceded.
You may find the function for dipole fitting in the file LICENSE in this directory.
### Key parameters
* feature: feature array except with dipole location (NXM 2-D array)
  * N denotes the number of convolutional filters (our case: 800)
  * M denotes the number of features except with dipole location (our case: 3)
* weights: weights for clustering process (1-D array, our data: 2 - spectral features, dipole location)
* draw_figures: flag for drawing figures (0: off, 1: on)
  * For example, using [1, 1] will enable Figure 1 (task relevancy bar graph) and Figure 2 (dipole distribution)
* data_path: path which includes data
### Usage (see main.m)
```MATLAB
[STUDY, ALLEEG]=Fx_cnn_group_level(STUDY, ALLEEG, feature, weights, draw_figures, data_path);
```
