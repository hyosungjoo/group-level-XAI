# Introduction
This project aims to develop a method for obtaining the group-level interpretation of EEG signals using a compact convolutional neural network (CNN). 
The group-level analysis comprises three procedures, namely, feature extraction, clustering of convolutional filters, and selective interpretation of task-relevant clusters. 
The source code includes clustering of convolutional filters and selective interpretation.
The sourc code for feature extraction are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
This project was funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant NRF-2020R1A2C2003319.

# Requirements
* MATLAB >= 2008b
* EEGLab >= 2021.1 (NEED FieldTriplite Plugin)

# Usage: Fx_cnn_group_level
### key parameters
* feature : feature array except with dipole location (NXM 2-D array)
  * N denotes number of convolutional filters (our case: 800)
  * M denotes number of features except with dipole location (our case: 3)
* weights : weights for clustering process (1-D array, our data: 2 - spectral features, dipole location)
* draw_figures : flag for drawing figures (0: off, 1: on)
  * ex) [1, 1] : sequentially figure1 (task relevancy bar graph) "on", figure 2 (dipole distribution) "on"
* data_path : path which includes data
### source code (see main.m)
```MATLAB
[STUDY, ALLEEG]=Fx_cnn_group_level(STUDY, ALLEEG, feature, weights, draw_figures, data_path);
